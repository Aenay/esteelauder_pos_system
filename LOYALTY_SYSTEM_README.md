# 🎯 Automatic Loyalty Points System

## Overview
The Esteé Lauder POS system now includes an **automatic loyalty points system** that rewards registered members for their purchases. Points are automatically calculated and awarded when orders are completed through the POS system.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Automatic Point Calculation
- **Rate**: 1 loyalty point for every $10 spent
- **Formula**: `Points = Floor(Purchase_Amount / 10)`
- **Examples**:
  - $25 purchase = 2 points
  - $99.99 purchase = 9 points
  - $100 purchase = 10 points

### Customer Eligibility
- ✅ **Eligible**: Registered members (Customer_Type ≠ 'walk_in')
- ❌ **Not Eligible**: Walk-in customers (Customer_Type = 'walk_in')

### Automatic Processing
- Points are awarded **immediately** when orders are completed
- No manual intervention required
- Points are tracked with detailed notes including order reference
- Automatic tier updates based on point accumulation

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Order Creation
When a customer completes a purchase through the POS system:

```php
// In PosController::completeSale()
if ($this->loyaltyService->isCustomerEligibleForLoyalty($customerId)) {
    $loyaltyPointsAwarded = $this->loyaltyService->awardPointsForPurchase($order);
}
```

### 2. Point Calculation
The system automatically calculates points based on the final purchase amount:

```php
public function calculatePointsForPurchase(float $amount): int
{
    return (int) floor($amount / 10);
}
```

### 3. Point Awarding
Points are automatically added to the customer's loyalty account:

```php
$loyaltyPoint->addPoints($pointsToAward, "Purchase reward for Order #{$order->Order_ID} - Amount: $" . number_format($order->Final_Amount, 2));
```

## 📊 Loyalty Tiers

| 🥈 Silver | 100-499 | Enhanced benefits |
